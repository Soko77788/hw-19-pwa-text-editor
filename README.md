  ## Tools and 3rd party assistance
  * Influenced with the week 19 PWA class mini project. 
   
   

  ## Obstacles and Successes
  * A lot of foreign concepts and words in this weeks module
  * Reading documentation to carefully get all the syntax right 
  * Importing so many little plugins with webpack and making them all work together.
  * Even following the class mini project closely still left me with a bunch of errors.
  * Instructor was even confused at points and needed to create work arounds which is even harder to follow 

  * Following the in class project helped set up most of the assignment
  * Getting the server running and the page displaying but working through errors
